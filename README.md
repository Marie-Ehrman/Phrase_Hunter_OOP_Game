 OOP Game Show App






## Intro

This Game Show App is a guessing game where the user guesses a letter in hopes of choosing the right letters in the selected mystery phrase.

The user has 5 chances before losing the game.


## jQuery
-jQuery was used in hopes of creating many neat animations, unfortunatley I cannot seem to get .animate() to work
-some listeners were left as jQuery code after the fact.


## Added features for Exceeds Expectations:

-Keyboard interactivity
-different colors on Start screen, background screen, right and wrong   letter choices, and win and loss screens. 
-different font-family for the game app
-"shake" animation if the player loses
-transition on chosen letter highlight
